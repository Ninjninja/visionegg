The Vision Egg is a programming library (with demo applications) that
uses standard, inexpensive computer graphics cards to produce visual
stimuli for vision research experiments.

Today's computer graphics cards, thanks to the demands of computer
gamers, are capable of drawing very complex scenes in a very short
amount of time. The Vision Egg allows the vision scientist (or anyone
else) to program these cards using OpenGL, the standard in computer
graphics programming. Potentially difficult tasks, such as initializing
graphics, getting precise timing information, controlling stimulus
parameters in real-time, and synchronizing with data acquisition are
greatly eased by routines within the Vision Egg.
