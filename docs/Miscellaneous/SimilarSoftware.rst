   There are as many ways of creating visual stimuli as there are vision
   experimenters.  Here I have listed all current solutions that I know
   of.  If you know of others, let me (astraw@users.sourceforge.net)
   know.

   At a first instance, check out Hans Strasburger's "`Software for
   visual psychophysics`_" webpage, which has much more coverage than
   this page.  I have here mainly limited listings to projects that
   appear to be under active development or support.

   The PsychToolbox_ is a great, free program that uses Matlab to display
   stimuli. Historically it is a Mac OS Classic application, but now a
   Windows port is available. A native OpenGL Mac OS X version is on its
   way. (Source code is available but not open source according to the
   `Open Source Initiative`_.)

   PsyScript_ is a Macintosh program for generating stimuli. Free, open
   source (GNU Public License). Uses AppleScript and a language based on
   ECL (experiment control language).

   Psyscope (classic Mac OS) users will be pleased to note `Psyscope X`_,
   is being ported to Mac OS X under the GNU GPL.

   Presentation_ Free (no longer appears to be free: 12/2005) Windows based stimulus generation.  Uses
   DirectX.

   WinVis_ web-based and Matlab based stimulus generation programs.

   VSG_ uses proprietary hardware and software to generate stimuli.  It
   lacks any hardware-accelerated 3D features.

   `OpenRT and OpenRT-3D`_ OpenGL stimulus generation.  Free, open
   source. (These links do not work any more... but there is OpenRT at http://www.openrt.de/, which is an OpenGL-like project used for real-time ray tracing).

   PsychoPy_ uses python and OpenGL together.  Free, open source.

   PXLab_ a collection of Java classes for running psychological
   experiments. Free.

   Guimigolus_ is a free extension to VisionEgg, that is able to
   guarantee framelossless presentation of Stimuli. We were able to
   create stimuli that run for **13 hours at 200Hz with not one frame
   lost** on a Win2k-System. This extension provides the programmer with a cpu-meter
   showing the time used for each frame, which is a great aid to
   time critical development. It has a very complex and great
   algorithm for measurement of buffer overruns.
   Not much documentation, and only german one, because we developed
   it in a course at
   the Carl v. Ossietzky University Oldenburg/Germany. Authors are
   Daniel Migowski and Guido Scherp. Download the file here:
   http://artis.uni-oldenburg.de/~migo/Guimigolus-0.7.win32.exe

   We won't develop Guimigolus any further, so we give it away
   now under GPL. Maybe it helps someone.
