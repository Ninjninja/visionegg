`[[Navigation(siblings)]]`_ We would like to thank everyone who has contributed suggetions, comments, and most of all, code to the Vision Egg.

To date, the Vision Egg has been primarily developed by AndrewStraw_, a post-doctoral scholar at Caltech_ in the lab of `Michael Dickinson`_.

This project began while I was a Ph.D. student at the `University of Washington`_ and later at the `University of Adelaide`_ in the lab of `David O'Carroll`_.  While a Ph.D. student, I was supported by Predoctoral Fellowship in the Biological Sciences from the `Howard Hughes Medical Institue`_.

Code contributors:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jamie Theobald, University of Washington (Labview code)

Major enhancements to the ephys server/GUI code to use normal (or slightly modified) demo scripts in this environment were done by Imran Ali and Lachlan Dowd in the lab of David O'Carroll at the University of Adelaide.

An initial patch for stereo support sent by Yuichi Sakano and Kevin J. MacKenzie at York University.

Parallel port enhancements by Hubertus Becker, University of Tübingen.

Arrow and FilledCircle stimuli by Hubertus Becker, University of Tübingen.
