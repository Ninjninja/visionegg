The Vision Egg is a powerful, flexible, and free way to produce
stimuli for vision research experiments.

About
=====

The Vision Egg is a high level interface between Python and OpenGL. In
addition to methods for automatic generation of traditional visual
stimuli such as sinusoidal gratings and random dot patterns, it has a
number of functions for moving numeric data, images, movies, text, and
3D objects to and from your video card and allowing use of some of its
features like perspective distortion. Therefore, it is also useful for
anyone wishing to make use of the features of today's graphics cards.

* Perform experiments using an inexpensive PC and standard consumer
  graphics card

* Perform experiments using a graphics workstation if special features
  needed

* Data acquisition and other realtime hardware control capabilities
  useful in electrophysiology and fMRI experiments, including
  gaze-contingent stimuli

* Dynamically generated stimuli can be changed in realtime via
  software or external hardware

* Produce traditional stimuli to replace legacy systems

* Produce stimuli not possible using other hardware

* Demo programs to get you started right away

* Run stimuli on your laptop - great for talks

* Free, open-source software

By harnessing the power of today's consumer graphics cards, producing
visual stimuli of research quality now requires no specialized
hardware beyond a relatively recent computer and graphics card.

Based on open standards, it runs on anything from cheap PCs to
expensive special hardware for special needs. For example, running on
some platforms, such as SGI workstations, the Vision Egg has a 10-bit
luminance dynamic range (both pixel depth and DAC) and precise
frame-by-frame control.

The Vision Egg is open source software (GNU LGPL). Therefore, you can
be assured of a product that meets your needs but does not lock you
in. Download_ it today and give it a try!
