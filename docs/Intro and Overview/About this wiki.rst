Intro and Overview/About this wiki

`[[Navigation(siblings)]]`_

Basics
======

The website is running on a MoinMoin_ installation. All pages are publicly modifiable, so if you see something that's wrong, fix it.  If you see something you don't like, adjust to your taste. Login and subscribe to changes on any page.

You can also create new pages.  I have attempted to maintain the hierarchy of the old Vision Egg website by using the tabs along the top.  If at all possible, please create a new page as a child of an already existing parent (for example, this page is a child of FrontPage_).

Links
=====

Here are some of the links provided with the wiki software:

* HelpContents_

* FindPage_

* RecentChanges_ to this website

Attachments
===========

I have disabled file uploading as a security precaution.  If you'd like to upload an image or other file to this website, either email it to me, drop it in my lab's ftp server (instructions here_), or coordinate a time with me where I enable file uploading.
