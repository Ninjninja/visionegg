Changes for 0.8.0:
------------------

MAJOR: Implemented new Screen, Viewport, Stimulus, Overlay, and
Presentation classes in VisionEgg.Core to more cleanly separate
components and allow multiple viewports on same screen.

MAJOR: Implemented new Parameters class in VisionEgg.Core to allow
more flexible control of any parameters which may change during or
between stimulus presentations.

New configuration system added.  VisionEgg.config holds system-wide
configuration defaults. 

Changed VisionEgg.py to Core.py, so now you must do "import
VisionEgg.Core".

Moved demo scripts into 'demo' directory within the main package.  Now
there is only one package to maintain.

Motion blur cache uses directory VisionEgg.config.VISIONEGG_STORAGE

Pulled texture stuff into Textures.py.

Pulled data acquisition stuff into Daq.py

Added lots of docstrings.

Created this changelog.
