OVERVIEW

Controlling the Vision Egg over TCP offers an easy way to integrate
immediately with any most computer setup.  For example, let's say you
control your stimulus device with Data Acquisition Product X to
generate in advance a waveform that controls your stimulus.  Instead
of a complete waveform, you can control the Vision Egg with a strings
sent over the network.  The demo/calibrate directory illustrates the
concept.  (Although it uses a Pyro connection rather than simple TCP.)
