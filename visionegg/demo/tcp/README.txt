OVERVIEW

Controlling the Vision Egg over TCP offers an easy way to integrate as
quickly as possible with most laboratory computer setups.

I think that using the demo programs will give you the best idea of
how it all works. Start gratingTCP first, then run gratingGUI.  After
you've played around with gratingGUI, you might want to try
controlling the Vision Egg with telnet or your favorite data
acquisition program with TCP capabilities.
